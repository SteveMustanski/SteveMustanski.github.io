        <h3>Scrum Master</h3>
        <p>I have over 10 years experience coaching teams in agile software delivery utilizing scrum, lean agile, and kanban
          delivery methods.
        </p>
        <p>By focusing on incrementally delivering their customer's highest priority features, teams are able to deliver
          quickly, without compromising on quality. I strive to work with teams and their product owners to ensure that teams
          are quickly and reliably delivering value to their customers.
        </p>
        <p>I also coach teams to adopt testing automation, pairing, and devops to improve their delivery capabilities.

        <h3>Front-end Developer</h3>
        <p>As a scrum master with several years of coding and database experience, I was selected to participate in a 2 month
          developer bootcamp through my employer. During the intensive bootcamp, I learned additional technical skils including
          HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, and Angular. I worked with other students in the bootcamp to deliver two full-stack
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>After the bootcamp, I worked with a project team delivering enhancements and new features to our company's customer
          facing web site. In addition to applying technologies learned in the bootcamp, I also spent time outside of work
          to learn Cucumber so that I could help document our application's functionality and automate our testing process.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to broaden my technical expertise, I became an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate in 2017.

        <h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
        <p>I work part-time at the University of Richmond as a Teaching assistant at a full-stack <a href="https://codingbootcamp.richmond.edu/"
            target="_blank">web developer bootcamp.</a>
          The bootcamp is delivered in collaboration with Trilogy Education Services.
        </p>
        <p>Students learn HTML/CSS, JavaScript, database, NodeJS, and React during a six month part-time bootcamp. Students
          also learn Git, termimal, devloper tools, and other tools used by full-stack web developers.
        </p>
        <p>I assist students with in-class activities, troubleshooting homework, and assisting with projects. In addition
          to in-class and office hours assistance, I grade and provide feedback on homework assignments.
